# Claude Code Pack

Platform-specific rules for Claude Code. Shared governance (hygiene, publication safety, role index, core delegation) is imported from `AGENTS.md` above via `@import`.

## Delegation rule

If `## Project policies` is missing, or if neither `.claude/.agents-mode.yaml` nor the matching global fallback `~/.claude/.agents-mode.yaml` exists for the current project, suggest running `/agents-init-project` before starting implementation work. If the project-local overlay is missing but the global one exists, ordinary reads should use the global file honestly until the user wants a project-local override.

When subagent delegation is appropriate, classify the task and pick the matching team template from `.claude/agents/team-templates/`.

External adapter preferences live in `.claude/.agents-mode.yaml`, with `~/.claude/.agents-mode.yaml` as the global fallback when the project-local overlay is absent. The file keeps `consultantMode` for consultant behavior, keeps `externalClaudeApiMode` immediately after it in the canonical YAML as the single Claude wrapper-transport toggle, adds `delegationMode`, `parallelMode`, and `mcpMode` for operator-level routing/tooling preference, keeps `preferExternalWorker` / `preferExternalReviewer` for eligible implement and review-side substitutions, and uses `externalProvider: auto | codex | claude | gemini` when the operator wants to steer provider-backed execution through the active named priority profile without changing team template JSON. `parallelMode` is the general helper fan-out rule across internal and external lanes; external opinion counts and brigade routing stay overlays on top of it. Claude-line canonical config may also include the shared `externalModelMode` and Gemini fallback when Gemini is the resolved provider, while `externalClaudeProfile` remains Codex-line only. On the Claude line, plain Claude CLI stays plain; under `externalClaudeApiMode: auto` the approved wrapper is only the named secondary Claude transport, and under `externalClaudeApiMode: force` it becomes the first Claude transport. `externalProvider: auto` is lane-driven, not host-default-driven; if a repository wants Gemini-first visual routing, express that through an explicit provider override or a repo-local custom profile.
If the effective Claude overlay exists but is stale, comment-free, or from an older pack version, decision-driving reads must normalize that file to the current canonical format before trusting its flags.

**Decision tree:**

1. Does the task need parallel risk owners (security + performance + ...)? → `requiresLead: true` template
2. Does it need implementation? No → `research` or `review`
3. One module, contracts unchanged? → `quick-fix`
4. Otherwise → `full-delivery`

**Templates:**

| Template | When | Lead needed? | Routing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `quick-fix` | Local additive change, one module, no new risk | No | Main conv → implementer → QA |
| `research` | Investigation, ADR, alternatives — no implementation | No | Main conv → analyst → architect → planner |
| `review` | Architecture/code quality gate, project audit, post-impl validation | No | Main conv → analyst → QA → reviewers |
| `full-delivery` | New feature, substantial change, multi-stage pipeline | Yes | `$lead` coordinates full pipeline |
| `security-sensitive` | Auth, trust boundaries, credentials, vulnerability | Yes | `$lead` coordinates, security-reviewer mandatory |
| `performance-sensitive` | Hard budgets, SLAs, latency targets | Yes | `$lead` coordinates, performance-reviewer mandatory |
| `geometry-review` | Spatial computation, transforms, meshing | Yes | `$lead` coordinates, computational-scientist + arch-reviewer |
| `combined-critical` | Multiple risk domains simultaneously | Yes | `$lead` coordinates all risk owners |

**Claude Code routing rules:**

- Every specialist invocation MUST use the Agent tool with the matching `subagent_type`. Do not simulate roles in the main conversation.
- If the template says `requiresLead: false`, the main conversation manages the chain directly — invoke specialists via Agent tool in order, pass each accepted artifact to the next.
- If the template says `requiresLead: true`, invoke `$lead` via Agent tool who coordinates work-items, risk owners, integration, and gates.
- Independent roles (e.g., security-engineer and performance-engineer) SHOULD be launched in parallel via multiple Agent tool calls in a single message when their scopes do not overlap.
- External adapter substitution is a routing decision, not a template change. When the preferences file favors external dispatch, eligible worker-side slots may route through `$external-worker` and eligible review/QA slots through `$external-reviewer`.
- Independent external adapters may also run in parallel when their scopes are disjoint and the selected provider runtimes support concurrent non-interactive execution. If native internal slot limits would otherwise block more independent eligible lanes, prefer available external adapters instead of silently serializing or dropping them.

**Recovery rule:**

- For `requiresLead: true` chains, `$lead` manages recovery through `work-items/` (roadmap.md, brief.md, status.md).
- For `requiresLead: false` chains with 2+ stages, the main conversation must save recovery state in `work-items/active/<date>-<slug>/` after each stage transition: `status.md` (format defined in `subagent-contracts.md` — includes template, orchestrator role, active/completed agents, next action) and the accepted artifact itself (e.g. `research.md`, `design.md`, `plan.md`). This allows any future session to resume from the last accepted artifact without replaying the chain.
- For single-specialist invocations (user names a role directly), no recovery file is needed.

## Role definitions

Role definitions live in `.claude/agents/<role>.md`.

## Publication safety scan

Pre-publication scan: run `/agents-check-safety`, or manually: `bash .claude/agents/scripts/check-publication-safety.sh` (Windows PowerShell: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .claude/agents/scripts/check-publication-safety.ps1`).

Claude secret-backed wrapper: `bash .claude/agents/scripts/invoke-claude-api.sh [args...]` or `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .claude/agents/scripts/invoke-claude-api.ps1 --% [args...]`. The wrapper prefers repo-local `.claude/SECRET.md` and then falls back to `~/.claude/SECRET.md`, exports the declared `ANTHROPIC_*` environment, and runs plain `claude`. Use the PowerShell wrapper from PowerShell and the bash wrapper from Bash or Git Bash; the PowerShell wrapper accepts both `-PrintSecretPath` and `--print-secret-path`, requires `--%` before forwarded Claude flags, and the bash wrapper honors `CLAUDE_BIN` when the active shell PATH cannot see `claude`.
