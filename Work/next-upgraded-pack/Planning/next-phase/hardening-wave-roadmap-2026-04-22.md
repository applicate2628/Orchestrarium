# Hardening Wave Roadmap

Date: 2026-04-22
Owner: `$lead`
Status: `ACTIVE`

## Purpose

Keep the next X1/X3 lane-fit hardening cycles grouped into explicit waves instead of ad-hoc
single-scenario pushes. This roadmap is the live control surface for subsequent diagnostic
scenarios after `N20`.

## Current Admission Source

Direct human instruction: continue benchmark hardening, split subsequent cycles into waves, maintain
a roadmap, and use spawns when that accelerates independent work.

## Operating Rules

| Rule | Contract |
|---|---|
| one live roadmap | update this file in place; do not create competing stale roadmaps |
| result source of truth | classify from `summary.json`, verifier logs, and scorer JSON, not noisy stdout |
| top-pair runs | every admitted wave runs `X1` and `X3` first |
| calibration rows | run `X2` and `X6` when the result may affect lane policy; run `X5` only after a same-session smoke writes output |
| route failures | keep quota, wrapper timeout, missing summary, and Gemini tool-loop failures separate from model FAIL |
| X4 | keep `NOT-RUN` until the secret-backed Claude route stops returning provider errors |
| write scope | main agent owns roadmap, scenario materialization, scorers, live result surfaces, and session logs |
| spawn scope | spawned agents may do read-only design/recon or disjoint implementation slices only when explicitly assigned |
| closeout | each admitted wave updates `x1-mainline-hardening-no-new-failures-2026-04-21.md`, role-fit scorecard, short results, status checkpoint, scorer JSON, and `.reports/2026-04/` |

## Wave Queue

| Wave | Status | Primary Question | Candidate Scenario | Owner | Spawn Plan | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `W0` completed baseline | `DONE` | Which lanes already have routing-grade evidence? | `N16..N20` | `$lead` | none now; complete | `PASS`: role-fit scorecard updated through `E10` |
| `W1` visual provider fit | `DONE` | Is Gemini actually better for visual/graphics work, or only policy-preferred? | `E11 / N21` visual asset or graphics-state rubric | `$graphics-engineer` + `$ui-test-engineer` style verifier | visual explorer proposal accepted and materialized | `X1`, `X2`, and `X3` scoreable PASS; `X3 100`, `X1 89`, `X2 85`; Gemini rows runtime no-summary after launch |
| `W2` hard numerical constraints | `DONE` | Can X1/X3 separate on algorithmic/numerical reasoning beyond N18? | `E12 / N22` numerical stability constraint gauntlet | `$algorithm-scientist` or `$computational-scientist` | numerical explorer proposal accepted and materialized | `X1` and `X3` both pass; `X2` scoreably fails; `X6` route-fails |
| `W3` owner recovery under stale-source traps | `DONE` | Does a longer recovery/routing packet split owner/orchestration style or correctness? | `E13 / N23` owner recovery packet | `$lead` with `$knowledge-archivist` constraints | owner explorer proposal accepted and materialized | `X1` and `X3` both pass; scored read favors `X3 100` over `X1 90` |
| `W4` repeat-confirmation | `DONE` for `N24`; `N25` queued conditionally | Are N19/N20/N23/N21 X3 edges stable enough for routing policy? | `N24` systems/toolchain repeat complete; `N25` UI repeat next only if UI routing policy is being hardened | matching implementation owner | repeat-confirmation spawn completed candidate table; N25 sidecar proposal received | `N24` confirms systems/toolchain `X3 primary`; run `N25` only for UI policy confirmation |
| `W5` scoring normalization | `DONE` | Should rubric scores be normalized across N16/N19/N20/N21/N22/N23 before stronger claims? | scorer-only analysis, no model run | `$qa-engineer` / `$analyst` | scorer-normalization spawn completed memo | compactness-only single-run winners downgraded to `provisional-primary` |

## Active Spawn Board

| Spawn | Scope | Write Access | Expected Artifact | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| visual explorer | inspect `S22/S23/S24`, scorecard, and N19/N20 patterns | none | proposal for `W1 / N21` | `DONE`; proposal accepted as queued input |
| numerical explorer | inspect `S10..S14`, N18, scorecard | none | proposal for `W2 / N22` | `DONE`; proposal admitted for next materialization |
| owner explorer | inspect N17 and owner/recovery evidence | none | proposal for `W3 / N23` | `DONE`; proposal accepted as queued input |
| repeat-confirmation explorer | inspect N19/N20/N23/N21 scorecard and evidence | none | candidate table for W4 repeats | `DONE`; `N24` systems/toolchain repeat admitted first |
| scorer-normalization auditor | inspect N16..N23 scorer comparability | none | scorer-normalization memo | `DONE`; scorecard now uses `provisional-primary` for compactness-only edges |

## Spawn Proposal Results

| Wave | Proposed Scenario | Useful Signal | Admission Read |
|---|---|---|---|
| `W1 / E11` | `N21-visual-provider-fit-raster-gauntlet` | deterministic raster oracle for transparent gaps, focus layering, legend order, annotation pixels, and PPM metadata | `DONE`; binary correctness tied X1/X3, X3 won rubric by compactness/cost, Gemini preference not proven because X5/X6 timed out after launch |
| `W2 / E12` | `N22-numerical-stability-constraint-gauntlet` | exact numerical witnesses for p95, variance, shard merge, memory bounds, and stale benchmark rejection | `DONE`; binary tie remained (`X1 PASS`, `X3 PASS`), scored read `X1 100`, `X3 99`, `X2 FAIL`, `X6 ROUTE-FAIL` |
| `W3 / E13` | `N23-owner-recovery-stale-source-routing-gauntlet` | recovery/source-of-truth discrimination under stale leaderboard, diagnostic-promotion, owner-route, and calibration traps | `DONE`; useful owner-lane scored split: `X3 100`, `X1 90`, `X2 FAIL`, `X6 ROUTE-FAIL` |
| `W4 / E14` | `N24-systems-toolchain-staging-repeat` | repeat N19-style path/cache/fingerprint/lease semantics before making systems/toolchain `X3` a hard primary | `DONE`; `X1 PASS 86`, `X3 PASS 95`; `X2`, `X5`, and `X6` scoreable `FAIL`; `X5` admitted after same-session smoke-output |
| `W4 / next` | `N25-ui-dirty-state-navigation-guard-gauntlet` | repeat N20-style UI implementation on dirty-state, navigation guards, validation, failed-save rollback, focus, and status rendering | `QUEUED`; run only if UI lane is the next policy target |
| `W5` | scorer-normalization memo | compare semantic versus efficiency points before cross-lane claims | `DONE`; current scorecard marks compactness/output edges as `provisional-primary` |

## Current Admission Decision

`W4 / N24` is complete and confirms the systems/toolchain read.

Reason: `N19` and `N24` now independently read `X3 95 / 100` versus `X1 86 / 100`, with both top
pair rows passing the binary verifier and calibration rows separating lower. This is enough to move
systems/toolchain from `X3 provisional-primary` to `X3 primary` for compact path/cache/fingerprint
and lease-lifecycle patches. The next conditional repeat is `N25` for UI implementation only if
the UI lane is the next policy target.

## Execution Order

1. Collect read-only spawn proposals for `W1..W3`. `DONE` on 2026-04-22.
2. Admit the highest-yield wave using this priority:
   - likely to change routing policy
   - executable verifier available without brittle external services
   - start-state failure set is precise
   - calibration rows can run without known route hangs
3. Materialize `W1 / N21` scenario and scorer. `DONE` on 2026-04-22.
4. Validate:
   - JSON parse
   - `--bundle-shape-only`
   - `--expect-start-state`
   - scratch reference solution passes verifier and local checks
   - `git diff --check`
5. Run:
   - `X1` via `cmd /c "pwsh ... < NUL"`
   - `X3` direct PowerShell runner
   - `X2`/`X6` when useful
   - `X5` only after a direct smoke writes output
6. Score and update live surfaces in place.
7. Re-rank the wave queue; continue while results are useful.
8. Materialize `W4 / N24` as a systems/toolchain repeat before hardening `X3` from provisional to hard primary. `DONE` on 2026-04-22.
9. If continuing same-lane confirmation, materialize `N25` as a UI dirty-state/navigation guard repeat; skip it if systems/toolchain was the only policy target.

## Current Routing Impact

| Lane | Current Read | Next Need |
|---|---|---|
| long-horizon integration | `X3` diagnostic edge from `N16` | repeat only if becoming hard policy |
| systems/toolchain | `X3` primary after `N19` and `N24` both read `95 / 100` versus `X1 86 / 100`; `X2/X5/X6` lower on N24 | no immediate repeat needed unless a new systems subdomain becomes policy-critical |
| UI implementation | `X3` provisional-primary signal from `N20`; `X2/X6` lower | `N25` queued if UI policy needs repeat confirmation |
| scientist/constraints | `X1/X3` correctness tie on `N18`; `N22` also ties by binary, with `X1 100`, `X3 99`, and `X3` far more compact | no more immediate numeric hardening; normalize runtime/cost only if policy depends on it |
| owner/orchestration | `N23` keeps binary tie but gives `X3` a `10` point scored edge over `X1`; W5 downgrades it to provisional before repeat | repeat only if becoming hard owner-routing policy |
| visual/graphics | geometry tied on `S22`; `N21` ties X1/X3 on visual correctness and favors X3 on compactness; Gemini preference not proven | repeat only after Gemini semantic route health is fixed |

## Resume Point

Resume from this roadmap plus:

- `Work/next-upgraded-pack/Results-drafts/role-fit-scorecard-v1-2026-04-22.md`
- `Work/next-upgraded-pack/Checkpoints/status-2026-04-16.md`
- latest scorer JSON under `Work/next-upgraded-pack/Evidence/`

If interrupted now, resume after the `W4 / N24` closeout commit. Systems/toolchain is confirmed:
`X3` is primary for compact path/cache/fingerprint/lease patches and `X1` is secondary when
test-rich edits matter. The next conditional work item is `N25` UI dirty-state/navigation guard
repeat, using the sidecar proposal recorded in the N24 session log and only if UI lane hardening is
the next policy target.
